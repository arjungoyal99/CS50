1.  Stdint.h is a header file which provide a set of tpyedefs that specify exact-width integer types.
2.  It makes clear that we intent to use a data in a specific way.
3.  BYTE is one byte; DWORD is 4 bytes; LONG is 4 bytes; WORD is two bytes.
4.  The first two bytes of a bmp must contain a word BM.
5.  bfSize is the size of the bmp file. While the biSize is the size of the structure.
6.  If biHeight is positive it means the image is bottom up whereas if the biHeight is negative it means the image is bottom down.
7.  biBitCount specifies the BMP color depth.
8.  fopen might return NULL if the doesn't exist.
9.  fread's third arguement is always 1 because we want to iterate over each pixel one at a time.
10. int padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4 = 3 ; but specifically if the bi.biWidth is 3 we need to add 3 bytes.
11. fseek skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel.
12. SEEK_CUR is the cuurent position indicator in the file.
